# Idea: Terminator Salvation Game

# Notes
Add game start menu select
based on whats pressed, send "easy, medium or hard" to the global script to init variables
then init based on those so that when adding weapons and stuff it known what is happening
can also add stuff that sends update requests if upgrades are done

FIND SOME WAY TO DEAL WITH RIGID BODY STUFF
RN ONLY THE BULLET HAS RIGID BODY AND THE ENEMIES DONT
MAY MAKE THEM HAVE 2 COLLIDER: 1 FOR THE BULLETS AND ONE FOR EACH OTHER
OTHERWISE HAVE TO DEAL WITH RIGID BODY FORCE TRANSFER SHENANIGANS
COULD JUST MAKE THE BULLET HAVE INSANELY LOW MASS AND SHOOTING POWER BUT THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR WHEN ENEMIES HAVE BEEN FIGURED OUT
